### Executive Summary
This project is about Hangman game, a guessing game where the player tries to guess a word, phrase, or sentence by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The game aims to help students in language schools learn English words or phrases in an entertaining way.

## Vision
This vision aims to explain the achievements of the application, targeting people of all ages interested in learning English vocabulary and phrases. The game offers various categories, a scoring system, and a world rank to enhance user engagement and learning.

### Reflection:
Writing the vision was challenging, balancing simplicity and coverage of the project's purpose. The process involved learning about creating effective vision statements.

## Project Plan
### 4.1 Introduction
Hangman game is a text-based guessing game in Java. The player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word or phrase. The project's main goal is to produce a console-based Hangman game and complete it within the given time frame.

### 4.2 Justification
The game serves entertainment purposes, particularly for those looking to learn English or improve their vocabulary.

### 4.3 Stakeholders
- Customers: Expecting a complete and enjoyable bug-free game.
- Developers: Aiming to develop a stable game.
- Testers: Seeking structured code for automated testing.
- Promoters: Responsible for marketing and making the game known.
- End-users: Students recommended to use the application for language learning.

### 4.4 Resources
The game uses Java, and resources include:
1. Oracle Java documentation
2. Software Engineering 10th ed. by Ian Sommerville
3. Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures 11th ed. by Y. Daniel Liang

### 4.5 Hard-Software Requirements
**Software Required:**
1. JDK (Java Development Kit) version 17 and Java Virtual Machine
2. IntelliJ IDEA version 2023.3.1 Ultimate Edition
3. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
4. Office Word (latest version)
5. Adobe Acrobat Reader

**Hardware Required:**
1. Computer capable of running the required software

### 4.6 Overall Project Schedule
1. **2024-02-03:** Project plan, Skeleton code.
2. **2024-02-10:** Modelling: Create Document Requirements, UML, and build a complete game structure.
3. **2024-02-17:** Testing various parts of the game and solving problems if needed.
4. **2024-02-20:** Hand-in project.

### 4.7 Scope, Constraints, and Assumptions
**Scope:**
- Text-based game with high score tables and word list customization.
- Menu for category selection.
- Player guessing random words.
- 10 chances for correct letters, no repeated letters.

**Constraints:**
1. Limited development time.
2. Runs only on Java environment.
3. No sound features.

**Assumptions:**
1. Playable on any Java execution program.
2. User knows how to set up the necessary environment.
3. User has JDK and JRE installed.
4. User has basic knowledge of English.

### Reflection
Understanding the level of detail for each part was challenging. Some parts lacked specific deadlines, so initial deadlines were used. Identifying stakeholders and understanding their roles was also challenging.

## Iterations
### 5.1 Iteration 1
In the first iteration, the project focuses on drawing up a plan, starting with simple execution, and creating basic classes.

- Hangman.java
- Player.java
- HangmanMain.java

## Risk Analysis
### 6.1 List of Risks
1. Time required for development and documentation.
2. Lack of knowledge.
3. Risk of data loss or computer crash.
4. Risk of developer sickness.

### 6.2 Strategies
1. Plan and use all available time.
2. Utilize available resources (books, internet).
3. Regularly backup project files.
4. Maintain a healthy lifestyle.

### Reflection
The nature of the project allows for control and reduction of risks. Some risks were personally experienced, affecting the project's progress.

## Time Log
### 7.1 First Iteration
| Task                     | Estimated time (hours) | Actual time used (hours) | Reflections                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Reading 4 chapters of course book | 4 | 6 | Required more time due to note-taking.     |
| Understand what the game is        | 0.5 | 0.25 | Played an online game to understand.       |
| General Information & Vision        | 1 | 1.5 | Challenges in understanding vision content. |
| Project plan                      | 8 | 12 | More time needed for understanding.        |
| Risk Analysis                    | 6 | 5  | Completed faster than expected.            |
| Skeleton of code                 | 4 | -  | Yet to complete at the time of logging.   |

## Handing In
The project plan, vision, and skeleton code are in progress, and subsequent iterations will involve further development and refinement.
